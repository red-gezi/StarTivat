This demo scene contains a hidden "Reflections Eraser" gameobject under "SampleSpheres".
It's an example of how you can prevent reflections in deferred by using stencil.
To make it work, enable the "Stencil Check" option in the Shiny SSR Volume and activate the gameobject: reflections will disappear behind the object.
